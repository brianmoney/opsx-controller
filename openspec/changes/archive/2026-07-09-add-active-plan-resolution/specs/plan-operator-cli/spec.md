## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Operators can activate a plan for subsequent commands

The orchestrator SHALL provide an `opsx-plan use <plan.toml>` command that records the active plan for the current repository.

The active-plan record SHALL be stored under `.opsx-plan/` and SHALL contain the selected plan as a repository-relative TOML path.

The `use` command SHALL validate that the target plan exists and can be loaded before writing the active-plan record.

#### Scenario: Operator activates a plan

- **WHEN** an operator runs `opsx-plan use openspec/plans/operator-workflow-upgrades-plan.toml`
- **THEN** the command records `openspec/plans/operator-workflow-upgrades-plan.toml` as the active plan under `.opsx-plan/` and reports the activated path

#### Scenario: Invalid plan is not activated

- **WHEN** an operator runs `opsx-plan use missing.toml` or points at an invalid plan manifest
- **THEN** the command exits with a clear error and does not replace the existing active-plan record

### Requirement: Operator commands resolve an omitted plan deterministically

The `run`, `status`, `approve`, `accept`, `reset`, `report`, and `dashboard` subcommands SHALL accept an omitted plan positional argument.

When a command needs a plan path, the orchestrator SHALL resolve the plan in this precedence order:

1. An explicit command-line plan argument.
2. The `OPSX_PLAN` environment variable.
3. The active-plan pointer file under `.opsx-plan/`.

If no plan can be resolved, the command SHALL exit with an actionable error that names `opsx-plan use <plan.toml>`.

#### Scenario: Explicit plan argument wins

- **WHEN** the active-plan pointer contains `openspec/plans/active.toml`, `OPSX_PLAN` is set to `openspec/plans/env.toml`, and the operator runs `opsx-plan status openspec/plans/explicit.toml`
- **THEN** `opsx-plan` loads `openspec/plans/explicit.toml`

#### Scenario: Environment variable wins over pointer

- **WHEN** the active-plan pointer contains `openspec/plans/active.toml`, `OPSX_PLAN` is set to `openspec/plans/env.toml`, and the operator runs `opsx-plan status` with no plan argument
- **THEN** `opsx-plan` loads `openspec/plans/env.toml`

#### Scenario: Pointer is used when no higher-precedence source exists

- **WHEN** the active-plan pointer contains `openspec/plans/active.toml`, `OPSX_PLAN` is unset, and the operator runs `opsx-plan run` with no plan argument
- **THEN** `opsx-plan` loads `openspec/plans/active.toml`

#### Scenario: Missing plan source reports activation command

- **WHEN** no explicit plan argument, `OPSX_PLAN`, or active-plan pointer is available
- **THEN** the command exits before loading a plan and tells the operator to run `opsx-plan use <plan.toml>`

### Requirement: Stale active-plan pointers fail closed

If the active-plan pointer exists but references a missing file, the orchestrator SHALL fail closed with an error that includes the recorded path.

The orchestrator SHALL NOT auto-discover another plan TOML, select a nearby plan, or silently clear the stale pointer.

#### Scenario: Pointer target is missing

- **WHEN** the active-plan pointer contains `openspec/plans/deleted.toml` and that file no longer exists
- **THEN** `opsx-plan status` exits with an error naming `openspec/plans/deleted.toml` and does not load any other plan

### Requirement: Successful compile and explicit run activate plans

After a successful `opsx-plan compile <source.md> -o <plan.toml>`, the orchestrator SHALL record the output TOML as the active plan.

After `opsx-plan run <plan.toml>` is invoked with an explicit plan argument and that plan loads successfully, the orchestrator SHALL record that explicit plan as the active plan.

Failed compile or run invocations SHALL NOT update the active-plan pointer.

#### Scenario: Compile output becomes active

- **WHEN** `opsx-plan compile openspec/plans/example.md -o openspec/plans/example.toml` succeeds
- **THEN** `openspec/plans/example.toml` is recorded as the active plan

#### Scenario: Explicit run path becomes active

- **WHEN** an operator runs `opsx-plan run openspec/plans/example.toml` and the plan loads successfully
- **THEN** `openspec/plans/example.toml` is recorded as the active plan

#### Scenario: Failed compile does not replace active plan

- **WHEN** an existing active plan is recorded and `opsx-plan compile` fails validation before writing its output
- **THEN** the existing active-plan record remains unchanged

### Requirement: Status output identifies the active plan

The `opsx-plan status` command SHALL include the currently active plan path in its human-readable output when an active-plan pointer is present.

If `status` is operating on a higher-precedence explicit or `OPSX_PLAN` path that differs from the pointer, the output SHALL still identify the recorded active-plan pointer separately from the plan being inspected.

#### Scenario: Status displays active plan

- **WHEN** the active-plan pointer contains `openspec/plans/active.toml` and the operator runs `opsx-plan status`
- **THEN** the status output includes `openspec/plans/active.toml` as the active plan

#### Scenario: Status distinguishes explicit plan from active pointer

- **WHEN** the active-plan pointer contains `openspec/plans/active.toml` and the operator runs `opsx-plan status openspec/plans/other.toml`
- **THEN** the status output identifies `openspec/plans/other.toml` as the inspected plan and `openspec/plans/active.toml` as the active plan pointer
